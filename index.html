            <hr class="style-one">
            <p class="aboutNVici">Natalia Vici (Monika Dominić) was born in 1992 in Zagreb.
                <br>
                Her love for electronic music started in early childhood thanks to her older sister who gave her the CDs
                which contained various styles of electronic music genres ranging from trance to techno.
                She went to her first party when she was 15 years old and that's when her love for techno music was
                born.
                After that she started exploring and informing herself about different styles of electronic music more
                actively.</p>

            <hr class="style-one">
            <p class="aboutNVici"> In year 2015 Natalia Vici began learning how to play and make her own sets which in
                the beginning were deep house,
                tech house and techno and later she decided to mostly focus on techno with a dark atmosphere, emotions
                and story. In her sets she always tries her best to tell a story and bring her audience on a journey in
                which she puts her whole heart and soul with the goal of making the audience feel her immense love for
                the music.
                <br>
                She shared the decks with some of the biggest names of Croatian techno scene like Rene Filipović RFL,
                Teo Harouda, Teo Zver, Active Line Six, Toxic, Matya, Senno, Kris M and Jolly Joke. The clubs she played
                at include Aquarius Zagreb, Sound Factory, One4One, Boogaloo club Zagreb, Felix Club in Ploče and
                Dubioza Bar, Osijek.</p>

        <div class="containerProduction">
            <h1 class="h1Nvici">Music production</h1>
            <hr class="style-one">
            <p class="aboutNVici"> In year 2016 she started producing music herself and is currently expecting her first
                release. While producing, she likes to explore different styles because she believes if she wants to
                better express herself as an artist, she shouldn't be limited to one style only.
                <br>
                Her wish is to continue her collaboration with other DJs and producers who share the same love for the
                music as she does and who all have the same goal, to unite through music.</p>
